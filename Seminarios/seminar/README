This directory contains the following files:

presentations.pdf    -- the talk in pdf format
presentations.tex    -- the LaTeX source for the talk
		     -- compile with "pdflatex presentations"
		     --     and then "ppower4 presentations.pdf \
		     --		presentations.pdf"
		     -- Note: This last step may spew errors and not work!
		     --	      Try instead "ppower4 presentations.pdf \
		     --		   presentations.out.pdf"
		     --	      and then the final product will be 
		     --	      "presentations.out.pdf"
whistler.jpg         -- a picture of a mosquito
lake1.jpg            -- a picture of a mosquito
mypic.eps            -- a picture of the earth
latecompare.pdf	     -- a matlab graphic saved as eps
		     --     and then converted using "epstopdf"
		     --	Note: The command "colordef none" in Matlab v5 & v6
		     --	      produces transparent backgrounds.  There may be
		     --	      a better way -- drop me a line if you find one.
simpleplot.pdf	     -- an xfig graphic saved as eps
		     --	    and then converted using "epstopdf"
