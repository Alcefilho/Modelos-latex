\begin{abstract}\noindent
\pf{powerdot} is a presentation class for \LaTeX\ that allows for
the quick and easy development of professional presentations. It
comes with many tools that enhance presentations and aid the
presenter. Examples are automatic overlays, personal notes and a
handout mode. To view a presentation, DVI, PS or PDF output can be
used. A powerful template system is available to easily develop new
styles. A \LyX\ layout file is provided.

\newpage
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This class gives you the possibility to easily create professionally
looking slides. The class is designed to make the development of
presentations as simple as possible so that you can concentrate on
the actual content instead of keeping yourself busy with technical
details. Of course, some knowledge of \LaTeX\ is still required
though.

This class builds on and extends the \pf{prosper} class
\cite{prosper} and the \pf{HA-prosper} package \cite{HA-prosper}.
The \pf{HA-prosper} package was initially intended to extend
\pf{prosper} and correct some bugs and problems of that class. As
developments on that package progressed, it was found that
unfortunately, not all of the problems could be overcome with the
package. That discovery was the start of a new project set up to
make a new class to replace the \pf{prosper} plus \pf{HA-prosper}
combination. You're currently reading the result of that project.

The remainder of this section will be devoted to giving a feel of
what the \pf{powerdot} presentation source looks like and giving an
overview of this documentation.

The document structure of a presentation is always the same. You can
find it in the example below.

\begin{example}
 \documentclass[<class options>]{powerdot}
 \pdsetup{<presentation options>}
 \begin{document}
   \begin{slide}{a slide}
     Contents of the slide.
   \end{slide}
   \section{first section}
   \begin{slide}[<slide options>]{another slide}
     Contents of the slide.
   \end{slide}
   \begin{note}{personal note}
     The note.
   \end{note}
 \end{document}
\end{example}

There are several elements that define the document structure. First
of all, the class accepts some class options that control the output
of the class, for instance, paper type and style. These class
options will be discussed in section~\ref{sec:classopts}. Then there
are presentation specific options which control some of the elements
of the presentation globally, for instance, the footers. These will
be discussed in section~\ref{sec:pdsetup}.

Once the setup has been decided on, you can use the slide
environment to produce slides (see section~\ref{sec:slides}) and the
note environment to produce notes that go with the slides (see
section~\ref{sec:notes}). You can use overlays to display material
in steps. This is described in section~\ref{sec:overlays}. The
|\section| command provides a way to structure your presentation.
This is discussed in section~\ref{sec:structure}.
Section~\ref{sec:styles} will show an overview of the styles that
come with this class and the characteristics of each style.
Section~\ref{sec:compiling} will tell you more about how to produce
output. This section contains important information on required
packages.

Section~\ref{sec:writestyle} is mostly interesting for people that
want to develop their own style for this class or want to modify an
existing style. Section~\ref{sec:lyx} explains how \LyX\
\cite{LyXWeb} can be used to create \pf{powerdot} presentations.
This documentation concludes with a section devoted to questions
(section~\ref{sec:questions}), like `Where can I find examples?'. It
also tells you where to turn to in case your questions are still not
solved.

\section{Setting up the presentation}\label{sec:setup}
This section will describe all options that are available to control
the output of the presentation and the looks of it.

\subsection{Document class options}\label{sec:classopts} We will
start with the class options that are typed in the |\documentclass|
command as a comma-separated list. For each option, the preset
value\footnote{The value that will be used when you don't use the
option.} will be mentioned in the description. This is the value
that will be used if you decide to not give a value to the option or
not use the option at all.

\DescribeOption{mode}
This options controls the kind of output that we want to produce.
The preset value is |present|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{mode=present}\\
This mode is used when you want to create the actual presentation. It
will enable overlays and transition effects. You can read more about
overlays in section~\ref{sec:overlays}.
\item\option{mode=print}\\
This mode can be used when printing the slides including their visual
markup, but without any overlay or transition effects.
\item\option{mode=handout}\\
This mode will produce a black and white overview of your slides that
can be used to make personal notes on, for distribution to students,
a personal guide during your talk, etcetera.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{nohandoutpagebreaks}\option{nohandoutpagebreaks}\\
By default, the handout mode produces a document with two slides per
page. If you want to fit more slides on a page, specify this option
in the |\documentclass| command and \pf{powerdot} will let \LaTeX\
decide on the places to insert a page break, namely when a page is
full.
\item\DescribeOption{nohandoutframes}\option{nohandoutframes}\\
In handout mode, each slide is contained in a frame by default. This option turns the frames off.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\DescribeOption{paper} This option has three possible values. The
preset value is |screen|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{paper=screen}\\
This is a special format with screen optimized ratio (4/3). The
actual page dimensions will be 8.25 inch by 11 inch. This paper format
is not available for print or handout mode. In these modes, \pf{powerdot}
will switch to a4 paper and put a warning that it did this in the
log file of your presentation.
\item\option{paper=a4paper}\\
A4 paper will be used for the presentation or handout.
\item\option{paper=letterpaper}\\
Letter size paper will be used.
\item\option{paper=smartboard}\\
smartboard size will be used (\verb|papersize={900pt,1440pt}|).
\end{description}
Some important information with respect to paper size, compiling and
viewing presentations is available in section~\ref{sec:compiling}.

\DescribeOption{orient} This controls the orientation of the
presentation. The preset value is |landscape|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{orient=landscape}\\
The presentation will be in landscape format. This value is not
available in handout mode. In that mode, \pf{powerdot} will switch
to portrait orientation and will warn you about this in the log
file.
\item\option{orient=portrait}\\ This produces slides in portrait
format. Notice that not all styles support portrait orientation. Please
refer to section~\ref{sec:styles} for information about which styles
do support the portrait orientation.
\end{description}

\DescribeOption{display} This controls the production of slides and
notes. The preset value is |slides|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{display=slides}\\
This will only typeset the slides in your presentation.
\item\option{display=slidesnotes}\\
This will typeset both the slides and the notes in your
presentation. See also section~\ref{sec:notes} for more information
about notes.
\item\option{display=notes}\\
This will typeset the notes only.
\end{description}

Here are some more options to control the output.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{size}\option{size}\\
This is the size of the normal text font in points. Possible values
are 8pt, 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt, 17pt and 20pt and the preset
value is 11pt.\footnote{Note that sizes other than 10pt, 11pt and
12pt are non-standard and it is assumed that you have the
\pf{extsizes} bundle \cite{extsizes} installed, which provides these
sizes.}
\item\DescribeOption{style}\option{style}\\
This controls the style to be loaded for the presentation. By
default, the \pf{default} style will be loaded. For more styles, see
section~\ref{sec:styles}.
\item\DescribeOption{fleqn}\option{fleqn}\\
This option makes equations flushed left. It does the same as the
equally named option for the article class.
\item\DescribeOption{leqno}\option{leqno}\\
Put equation numbers at the left. Also the same as in the article
class.
\item\DescribeOption{nopsheader}\option{nopsheader}\\
By default, \pf{powerdot} will write a postscript command to the ps
file to make sure that post processors like ps2pdf know which paper
to use without the need to specify it on the command line. See also
section~\ref{sec:compiling}. If you experience problems with post
processing or printing or you want to specify the paper size in the
post processing steps yourself, use this option.
\item\DescribeOption{hlentries}\option{hlentries}\\
This highlights table of contents entries when the entry matches
with the current slide and its preset value is |true|. See also
section~\ref{sec:structure}. If you don't want highlighting of table
of contents entries (for instance in print mode), use
|hlentries=false|.
\item\DescribeOption{hlsections}\option{hlsections}\\
This highlights table of contents sections when the section matches
with the current section in the presentation and is preset to |false|.
See also section~\ref{sec:structure}. Specifying this
option turns highlighting of sections on. This could be useful when
you are using a style that implements a split table of contents.
\item\DescribeOption{pauseslide}\option{pauseslide}\\
This option inserts an empty slide (black by default) in the presentation on page 1 and
will automatically advance to page 2 when opening the presentation
in a PDF viewer like Acrobat (Reader). The option also inserts a
link behind every slide or section title that brings you to the
pause slide when clicked. When you click anywhere in the pause
slide, you will go back to the originating slide. This option can be
used to temporarily pause a presentation, for instance, to do a
proof on the black board. You can use a different color than black
by specifying it after the option, for instance, |pauseslide=white|.
\item\DescribeOptions{clock}\option{clock}\\
This displays a small digital clock on slides which you can use to
check the time left for your presentation.
\end{description}

Here is an example of a |\documentclass| command.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass[
   size=12pt,
   paper=screen,
   mode=present,
   display=slidesnotes,
   style=tycja,
   nohandoutpagebreaks,
   pauseslide,
   fleqn
 ]{powerdot}
\end{example}
This example sets up a presentation in \pf{tycja} style, with a black
slide, normal size 12 points and flushed left equations.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass[
   size=12pt,
   paper=letterpaper,
   mode=handout,
   display=slidesnotes,
   style=tycja,
   nohandoutpagebreaks,
   pauseslide,
   fleqn
 ]{powerdot}
\end{example}
Changing the |paper| and |mode| options, now produces a handout with
possibly more than two slides per page due to the |nohandoutpagebreaks|
option.

\subsection{Setup options}\label{sec:pdsetup}
\DescribeMacro{\pdsetup}
There are several extra options that can help customizing your
presentation. These options are not available via the
|\documentclass| command. This has a technical reason.\footnote{The
interested reader is referred to the section about the \pf{xkvltxp}
package in the \pf{xkeyval} package documentation \cite{xkeyval}.}
We distinguish two types of options. Options that can only be set
globally (acting for the entire presentation) using the |\pdsetup|
command and options that can be accessed both globally (via
|\pdsetup|) and locally (via slide environments, see section~\ref{sec:slides}).

\subsubsection{Global options}\label{sec:gopts}
This section describes options that can only be used globally in the
preamble of your presentation via the |\pdsetup| command.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{palette}\option{palette}\\
This specifies the palette to be used. A palette is a set of colors
defined by a style. To find out which palettes are defined by each
style, see section~\ref{sec:styles}.
\item\DescribeOption{theslide}\option{theslide}\\
This option controls how the slide number appears on the slide. This
is preset to the value |\arabic{slide}~/~\pageref*{lastslide}|,
which could appear like |5/22|. Notice that the |\arabic{slide}|
typesets the number of the current slide and that
|\pageref*{lastslide}| typesets the number of the last
slide.\footnote{We use the starred version of \cs{pageref} which is
defined by \pf{hyperref} and does not create a link to the page that
it is referring to.}
\item\DescribeOption{thenote}\option{thenote}\\
This is similar to the |theslide| option, but typesets the slide
numbers of notes. The preset value is
|note~\arabic{note}~of~slide~\arabic{slide}| and |\arabic{note}|
here typesets the number of the current note that goes with the
current slide. This could appear like |note 2 of slide 7|.
\item\DescribeOption{counters}\option{counters}\\
The |counters| option lists counters that you might want to protect
on overlays. As material on overlays (see
section~\ref{sec:overlays}) is processed multiple times, also
\LaTeX\ counters, like the |equation| counter, might be increased
too often. To avoid that your equations get different numbers on
every overlay, use this option. The |equation|, |table|, |figure|,
|footnote| and |mpfootnote| counters are already protected for you.
If you use extra counters, for instance for theorems, list them in
this option. Example:
\begin{example}
 counters={theorem,lemma}
\end{example}
\item\DescribeOption{list}\option{list}\\
This option takes a list of options that will be passed on to the
\pf{enumitem} package that controls the layout of lists created by
the |enumerate| and |itemize| environments. Example:
\begin{example}
 list={labelsep=1em,leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,topsep=5pt,parsep=0pt}
\end{example}
See for more information on controlling the layout of lists the
\pf{enumitem} package \cite{enumitem}.
\item\DescribeOptions{enumerate,itemize}\option{enumerate,itemize}\\
As the |list| option, but only control |enumerate| and |itemize|
environments respectively.
\item\DescribeOption{clockformat}\option{clockformat}\\
This option specifies the format of the clock. The format is set using
Acrobat's |util.printd| function.\footnote{For a complete listing of
allowable formats, consult the \textit{Acrobat JavaScript Scripting
Reference}\cite{javascript}.} The default value is |HH:MM:ss|, which
shows a 00-23 hour, 00-59 minute, 00-59 second clock. Example:
\begin{example}
clockformat=h:MM tt
\end{example}
The above setting will display a 1-12 hour, 00-59 minute, am/pm clock.
That is, the clock might show |5:53 pm|.
\item\DescribeOption{clockrefresh}\option{clockrefresh}\\
This option should be a number which specifies how often
the clock is refreshed in milliseconds. The default behavior is to refresh
the clock every second. Thus, the default value is 1000. Notice, if the
|clockformat| is such that seconds are not shown, then it makes no sense
to update that clock every second.  A corresponding example:
\begin{example}
clockrefresh=60000
\end{example}
The interpretation of this is that the clock will be updated every minute.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Global and local options}\label{sec:glopts}
This section describes options that can be used both globally via
|\pdsetup| and locally via slide environments (see section~\ref{sec:slides}).
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOptions{lf,cf,rf}\option{lf,cf,rf}\\
This determines the content of the left, center and right footers.
These are preset to empty.
\item\DescribeOption{trans}\option{trans}\\
This option sets the default transition effect to be used in the
presentation. These transition effects only work after compiling the
presentation to PDF format. See also section~\ref{sec:compiling}.
The following transition effects are supported: |Split|, |Blinds|,
|Box|, |Wipe|, |Dissolve|, |Glitter| and |Replace|. When you are using
a viewer that understands PDF 1.5, you can also use |Fly|, |Push|,
|Cover|, |Uncover| or |Fade|. It is important to notice that most
viewers are case sensitive, so, for instance, |box| will not work.

The preset effect is |Replace| which just replaces one slide with
another when browsing the slides. Note that some PDF viewers (like
Acrobat Reader 5 and higher) only produce the transition effect in
full screen mode. If you want to use a custom transition effect that
is not listed in the list above (for instance, a wipe effect with a
custom wipe direction), then that is possible. However,
\pf{powerdot} will put a warning in your log file that the effect
that you have chosen, might not work in the PDF viewer. Here is an
example that does work.
\begin{example}
 trans=Wipe /Di 0
\end{example}
In Acrobat (Reader), this wipes from left to right instead of the
default top to bottom. For more information, see a PDF Reference
Manual.
\item\DescribeOption{method}\option{method}\\
This option can be used when a slide contains special material that
does not get treated in the `usual' way by \LaTeX. Verbatim material
is an example of this. Possible values are |normal| (the preset value),
|direct| and |file|. We will come back to this option in detail in
section~\ref{sec:verbatim}.
\item\DescribeOptions{logohook,logopos,logocmd}\option{logohook,logopos,logocmd}\\
If |logopos| is specified, a logo defined by the value of the
|logocmd| option will be put on slides. The position can be
specified relative to the width and height of the slide. |{0,0}| is
the lower left corner of the paper and |{\slidewidth,\slideheight}|
is the upper right corner. For positioning the logo, the |\rput|
command of \pf{pstricks} \cite{PSTricksWeb,PSTricks} is used. This
command also allows to specify the point of the logo that should be
positioned there. This point can be entered via the |logohook|
option and can take the values |tl|, |t|, |tr|, |r|, |Br|, |br|,
|b|, |bl|, |Bl|, |l|, |B| and |c|. For more information about
|\rput|, consult the \pf{pstricks} documentation. Here is an example
that integrates the flower of the \pf{default} style into the
\pf{husky} style.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass[style=husky]{powerdot}
 \pdsetup{
   logohook=t,
   logopos={.088\slidewidth,.99\slideheight},
   logocmd={\includegraphics[height=.08\slideheight]{powerdot-default.ps}}
 }
 \begin{document}
 ...
 \end{document}
\end{example}
The preset value for |logohook| is |tl|.
\end{description}

A special feature of \pf{powerdot}, which can be used to make
presentations come alive, is the use of random dots. These dots will
be placed anywhere on your slides and use the colors defined by the
palette that you use. Overlays will carry the same dots. This
feature uses |random.tex| \cite{random}. Several options are
available to control the appearance of the random dots.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{randomdots}\option{randomdots}\\
By default, random dots are turned off. If this option is set to
|true|, random dots will be generated. |false| will turn off the
feature. When no value is submitted to the option, |true| will be
used.
\item\DescribeOptions{dmindots,dmaxdots}\option{dmindots,dmaxdots}\\
The number of dots per slide is also random. These options set the
minimum and maximum dots per slide. Preset values are |5| and |40|,
respectively.
\item\DescribeOptions{dminsize,dmaxsize}\option{dminsize,dmaxsize}\\
The minimum and maximum radius of the dots. Preset values are |5pt|
and |40pt|, respectively.
\item\DescribeOptions{dminwidth,dmaxwidth,dminheight,dmaxheight}
\option{dminwidth,dmaxwidth,dminheight,dmaxheight}\\
These options determine the area on the slide that can be used for
the random dots. These values are preset such that dots go anywhere
on the slide, but you might want to adjust these such that, for
instance, dots can only appear in the text area. The preset values
are |0pt|, |\slidewidth|, |0pt|, |\slideheight|.

Here is an example that allows dots in a smaller rectangle on the
slide.
\begin{example}
 \pdsetup{
   dminwidth=.1\slidewidth,dmaxwidth=.9\slidewidth,
   dminheight=.2\slideheight,dmaxheight=.8\slideheight
 }
\end{example}
\item\DescribeOption{dbright}\option{dbright}\\
This option can be used to adjust the brightness of the dots. The
number should be an integer between -100 and 100. If the number is
negative, the color will be adjusted towards black, with -100 giving
black. If the number is positive, the color will be adjusted towards
white, with 100 giving white. With a light background, you may want
to choose |bright| to be positive. With a dark background, you may
want to set it negative. The preset value is |60|, meaning a mixture
of 40\% of the original color and 60\% white.
\item\DescribeOption{dprop}\option{dprop}\\
This option is used for passing extra parameters to the |\psdot|
command, which creates the random dots. You could, for instance,
change the style of the dots or the line width. See for more
information about |\psdot| the \pf{pstricks} documentation
\cite{PSTricksWeb,PSTricks}. \pf{powerdot} defines two extra dot
styles that can be used for the random dots. These styles are
|ocircle| (open circle) and |osquare| (open square).
\end{description}

Here are two examples for the use of random dots.
\begin{example}
 \pdsetup{
   randomdots,dminwidth=.2\slidewidth
 }
\end{example}
This turns on random dots and doesn't use the left 20\% of the slide
for placing random dots.
\begin{example}
 \pdsetup{
   randomdots,dprop={dotstyle=ocircle,linewidth=.5pt},
   dminsize=500pt,dmaxsize=600pt,dmindots=2,dmaxdots=5
 }
\end{example}
This example puts at most 5 big circles on slides. These circles do
not fit on the slides and you will only see parts of them in the
shape of curves.

\subsubsection{\cs{pdsetup} example}
Here is an example of a |\pdsetup| command that one could use to set up
the presentation.
\begin{example}
 \pdsetup{
   lf=My first presentation,
   rf=For some conference,
   trans=Wipe,
   theslide=\arabic{slide},
   randomdots,dmaxdots=80
 }
\end{example}
This sets the left and right footers and will initialize the
transition effect to |Wipe|. Further, slide numbers will not include
the number of the last slide, but only the number of the current
slide. Finally, slides will be covered with at most 80 random dots.

A small note is necessary with respect to the appearance of footers.
The slide number (controlled by the |theslide| option) will be added
to a footer. Most styles add it too the right footer. If both the
footer and the slide number are non empty, |~--~| will be inserted
in between them to separate them. Styles might modify this default
behavior however.

\section{Making slides}\label{sec:slides}
\subsection{The title slide}\label{sec:titleslide}
\DescribeMacro{\title}
\DescribeMacro{\author}
\DescribeMacro{\and}
\DescribeMacro{\date}
\DescribeMacro{\maketitle}
The title slide is created by the |\maketitle| command.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{maketitle}\oarg{options}'
\end{command}
Its use is the same as in the standard \LaTeX\ document classes. The
optional argument \meta{options} can contain any option from
section~\ref{sec:glopts}. Specifying such an option in the
|\maketitle| command will only have an effect on the title slide and
not on other slides. See an example below.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass{powerdot}
   \title{Title}
   \author{You \and me}
   \date{October 7, 2010}
 \begin{document}
    \maketitle
    ...
 \end{document}
\end{example}
The |author|, |title| and |date| declarations provide the text to be
used when making a title page. The design of the title page is
specific to the style in use. Notice the use of |\and| for
separating multiple authors. See a \LaTeX\ manual \cite{companion}
for more information on commands such as |\title| and |\author|.

\subsection{Other slides}\label{sec:otherslides}
\DescribeEnv{slide} The centerpiece of every presentation is the
slide. In \pf{powerdot}, the content of each slide is placed in a
|slide| environment.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{begin}\texttt{\{slide\}}\oarg{options}\marg{slide title}'
 `\meta{body}'
 `\cs{end}\texttt{\{slide\}}'
\end{command}

In section~\ref{sec:overlays} we'll see how to give some life to the
slides, but for now, let's look at a simple example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{First slide}
   Hello World.
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
The slide environment has one required argument, namely the slide
title. When a slide is created, the slide title is used to create an
entry in the table of contents and in the list of bookmarks. The
table of contents is a listing of the slides and section titles in
the presentation that appears on each slide.

The table of contents is clickable (when the presentation is
compiled into PDF) and serves as a nice way to jump from location to
location within the presentation. The bookmark list is only present
when compilation is taken all the way to the PDF file format. It
also serves as a table of contents, but this list does not appear on
\textit{any} of the slides, but in a separate window in a PDF
viewer. In the example above, the entries in both table contents and
the list of bookmarks would be titled |First slide|.

The \meta{options} for the |slide| environment can contain any
option listed in section~\ref{sec:glopts}. Additionally, the
following options can be used.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{toc}\option{toc}\\
When specified, the value is used for the entry in the table of
contents; otherwise, the slide title is used. If |toc=| is
specified, then no entry is created.
\item\DescribeOption{bm}\option{bm}\\
When specified, the value is used for the bookmark entry; otherwise,
the slide title is used. If |bm=| is specified, then no entry is
created.
\end{description}

These optional arguments are especially useful when the title of a
slide is extremely long or when the title contains \LaTeX\ commands
that do not render correctly in the bookmarks.\footnote{The
bookmarking procedure uses \cs{pdfstringdef} from the \pf{hyperref}
package, and it can process accented characters such as \cs{"i}.}
When specifying entries, be sure to hide special characters `|,|'
and `|=|' between curly brackets `|{|' and `|}|'. Let's look at an
example that uses these optional arguments.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}[toc=,bm={LaTeX, i*i=-1}]{\color{red}\LaTeX, $i^2=-1$}
   My slide contents.
 \end{slide}
\end{example}

In this example, the slide title will appear as {\color{red}\LaTeX,
$i^2=-1$}. This text will not render correctly in a bookmark entry.
An attempt is made to correct this, but often, the correction does
not produce an equivalent text. This particular title would be
rendered in the bookmark list as |redLaTeX, i2=-1|. On the other
hand, the manually specified bookmark entry is rendered as:
|LaTeX, i*i=-1|. Notice, no entry is created in the table of contents,
because of the use of |toc=|.

In addition to the |slide| environment, each individual style can
define its own environments. Many styles have a |wideslide|
environment. The idea is that one might have information that does
not fit nicely on a slide with a table of contents listed, as this
consumes some space. In such cases, it is preferable to use a slide
that does not list the table of contents. The |wideslide|
environment provides this functionality and has more space for the
actual slide content. See section~\ref{sec:styles} for information
on the various environments provided by the styles.

\section{Overlays}\label{sec:overlays}
It is often the case that you don't want all the information on the
slide to appear at once. Rather, the information should appear one
item at a time. In \pf{powerdot}, this is achieved with overlays.
Each slide can be comprised of many overlays, and the overlays are
displayed one at a time.

\subsection{The \cs{pause} command}\label{sec:pause}
\DescribeMacro{\pause} The easiest way to display information
sequentially is to use the |\pause| command.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{pause}\oarg{number}'
\end{command}
Below is a simple example:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Simple overlay}
   power\pause dot
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
The slide's information is displayed and continues until the
|\pause| command is encountered. No further output within the same
slide is displayed until the click of the mouse or the touch of the
keyboard. Then, the content will continue to display until all the
information is displayed or until another |\pause| command is
encountered. In this example, |power| is displayed on the first
overlay, and |powerdot| is the displayed on the second overlay.  The
|\pause| command is often used within the |itemize| and |enumerate|
environments. For example,
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Multiple pauses}
   power\pause dot \pause
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Let me pause\ldots \pause
     \item \ldots while I talk \pause and chew bubble gum. \pause
     \item Perhaps you'll be persuaded.
     \item Perhaps not.
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Since |\pause| was used before the |itemize| environment, no item
will appear until the third overlay. Then, each item will be
displayed one at a time, each on their own overlay. More information
on using lists will follow in the next section.

The optional argument of the |\pause| command specifies the number
of overlays to pause. An example usage is:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Pause longer}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item A \pause
     \item B \pause[2]
     \item C
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
In the example above, item |C| will appear on the fourth overlay.
The usefulness of this option will become more apparent in the next
section; so we will revisit a similar example at that time.

\subsection{List environments}\label{sec:lists}
The list environments, |itemize| and |enumerate|, have special
treatments in \pf{powerdot}. They have an optional argument that
will be taken care off by the \pf{enumitem} package (see
\cite{enumitem}). \pf{powerdot} supplies an extra key for this
optional argument. In the examples that follow, features will be
described using the |itemize| environment but they also apply to the
|enumerate| environment.

Here is the typical usage of the |itemize| environment:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Basic itemize}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item A \pause
     \item B \pause
     \item C
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
The display is simple, each item appears one at a time with each
overlay.

\DescribeOption{type}
Suppose we wanted every item to show, but we only wanted one item to
appear `active' at once. This can be accomplished via the |type|
option for the |itemize| environment. The preset value is |0|.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Type 1 itemize}
   \begin{itemize}[type=1]
     \item A \pause
     \item B \pause
     \item C
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Now, every item will be displayed in the \emph{inactive
color}\index{inactive color|usage} (which is defined by the style
that you use), and the item's font color will become the active one
on the overlay that it would normally appear on. The default
behavior is given by |type=0|. It is still possible to pass
optional arguments to \pf{enumitem} via the second optional argument:

\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Type 1 itemize}
   \begin{enumerate}[type=1][label=\romani*)]
     \item A \pause
     \item B \pause
     \item C
   \end{enumerate}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Take care, that this must always be the second optional argument!
It is possible to leave the first one empty, which is valid only for \pf{powerdot}.


Lists can also be nested to create complicated structures. When a
list is nested, it inherits the setting of the |type| option from
the `parent' list, but that can be overruled by specifying the
|type| option in the optional argument of the nested list. We
present here one example, but many more can be created by nesting
lists of different types in different ways.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Nested lists}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item A\pause
     \begin{itemize}[type=1]
       \item B\pause
     \end{itemize}
     \item C
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
This displays |A| and |B| on the first overlay, but |B| is inactive.
On overlay 2, |B| will become active and on overlay 3, |C| will
become visible.

\subsection{The \cs{item} command}
\DescribeMacro{\item}
The |\item| command has an extra \emph{optional} argument in
\pf{powerdot} which allows for creating overlays in a more flexible
way then |\pause| provides.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{item}\oarg{label}\larg{overlays}'
\end{command}
This optional argument should contain an overlay specification
stating on which overlays you want the item to appear. This
specification is a comma separated list where each item can used the
notation as in table \ref{tab:item}.
\begin{table}[htb]\centering
\begin{tabular}{d}
Syntax&Meaning\\\hline
\texttt{x}&Only overlay \texttt{x}\\
\texttt{-x}&All overlays up to and including \texttt{x}\\
\texttt{x-}&All overlays from \texttt{x}, including \texttt{x}\\
\texttt{x-y}&All overlays from \texttt{x} to \texttt{y},
including \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\cs{item} and \cs{onslide} notation}\label{tab:item}
\end{table}
The \meta{label} argument is the standard optional argument for
|\item| in \LaTeX. A \LaTeX\ manual \cite{companion} can tell you
more about this argument.

Here is an example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Active itemize}
   \begin{itemize}[type=1]
    \item<1> A
    \item<2> B
    \item<3> C
   \end{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Here we have said that |A| should only be active on overlay 1, |B|
should only be active on overlay 2, and |C| should only be active on
overlay 3. Again, when the item is not active, it appears in the
inactive color because of |type=1|.

If |type=0| is specified and if each item is given an overlay
option, then each item will appear only when it is active. When the
item is not active, then it will not show on the slide at all. More
examples demonstrating the syntax for \meta{overlays} will be
discussed in the next section.

\subsection{The \cs{onslide} command}\label{sec:onslide}
\DescribeMacro{\onslide} Overlays can also be achieved using the
|\onslide| command.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{onslide}\marg{overlays}\marg{text}'
\end{command}
This command takes an \meta{overlays} specification as first
argument and the \meta{text} to apply it to as second argument. The
\meta{overlays} on which the text will appear are specified as a
comma separated list with syntax as in table \ref{tab:item}. We
start off with a simple example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Simple onslide}
   \onslide{1,2}{power}\onslide{2}{dot}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
We have instructed |power| to appear on overlays one and two, and
|dot| to appear only on overlay two. As you might guess, this
example has the same output as our first |\pause| example. Yet, it
is clearly the case that our syntax is more complicated. However,
this slight ``complication'' also allows for much more flexibility.

\DescribeMacro{\onslide+}Consider the above example with the
following modifications:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Simple onslide+}
  \texttt{onslide }: \onslide{1}{power}\onslide{2}{dot}\\
  \texttt{onslide+}: \onslide+{1}{power}\onslide+{2}{dot}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
The |\onslide+| command displays its content in a different manner
altogether. Now, |dot| appears on every overlay, but it is in
inactive color\index{inactive color|usage} and matches the normal
font color \textit{only} on overlay two. This is comparable to the
|type=1| behavior for lists (see section~\ref{sec:lists}).

When executing this example, we will also notice that the |\onslide|
command does hide material, but still reserves the right amount of
space for it: on overlay 2, the |dot|s appear right above each
other. The next command does not reserve space.

\DescribeMacro{\onslide*} Instead of hiding and reserving space
(|\onslide|) or putting \meta{text} in the inactive color
(|\onslide+|) when the overlay doesn't match \meta{overlays}, this
command just eats the material altogether. To understand the
differences, consider the following example:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Simple onslide*}
  \texttt{onslide }: \onslide{1}{power}\onslide{2}{dot}\\
  \texttt{onslide+}: \onslide+{1}{power}\onslide+{2}{dot}\\
  \texttt{onslide*}: \onslide*{1}{power}\onslide*{2}{dot}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
The output of the first two lines, we are already familiar with. The
third line displays |power| on overlay 1 and |dot| on overlay 2, but
no space for |power| is reserved on overlay 2. Hence |dot| will
start on the cursor position that |power| started on overlay 1 and
it is not aligned below the other two |dots|.

We finish with an example of the syntax that is possible with
|\item| and |\onslide|. Remember that these commands take a comma
separated list for the \meta{overlays} specification and that each
element can used the syntax as explained in table \ref{tab:item}.
The various variations are demonstrated in the example below.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Lists}
   \onslide{10}{on overlay 10 only}\par
   \onslide{-5}{on every overlay before and including overlay 5}\par
   \onslide{5-}{on every overlay after  and including overlay 5}\par
   \onslide{2-5}{on overlays 2 through 5, inclusive}\par
   \onslide{-3,5-7,9-}{on every overlay except overlays 4 and 8}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}

\subsection{Relative overlays}
Sometimes it is a pain to keep track of when an item should appear
or become active. You might, for example, just care that some text
appears on the overlay \textit{after} some other item. This
functionality is provided through the use of relative overlays which
should not be used outside list environments that use |\item|. Let's
consider a simple, illuminating example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Relative overlays}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item A \pause
     \item B \onslide{+1}{(visible 1 overlay after B)}\pause
     \item C \onslide{+2-}{(appears 2 overlays after C, visible until the end)}
     \pause
     \item D \onslide{+1-6}{(appears 1 overlay after D, visible until overlay 6)}
     \pause
     \item E \pause
     \item F \pause
     \item G \onslide{+1-+3}{(appears 1 overlay after G for 3 overlays)}\pause
     \item H \pause
     \item I \pause
     \item J \pause
     \item K
   \End{itemize}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
As you can see, we still use |\onslide|. The only change is with the
syntax of the list of overlays. Now, we can specify a `|+|' symbol
in the list. In its simplest usage, |\onslide{+1}| will make text
display one overlay after the overlay it would \textit{normally}
appear on. You can still use the syntax in table \ref{tab:item}.
These are demonstrated in the above example. Notice,
|\onslide{+1-6}| means that the text will appear one overlay after
the overlay it would normally appear on and that the text should
remain shown until overlay seven. To make text appear for a range of
relative overlays, see the final demonstration in the above example.

\section{Presentation structure}\label{sec:structure}
\subsection{Making sections}\label{sec:section}
\DescribeMacro{\section}
This section describes the |\section| command which provides a way
to structure a presentation.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{section}\oarg{options}\marg{section title}'
\end{command}
This command will produce a slide with \meta{section title} on it
and will also use this text to create sections in the table of
contents and in the bookmarks list. There are several \meta{options}
to control its output.

\DescribeOption{tocsection} This option controls the creation of a
section in the table of contents. The preset value is |true|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{tocsection=true}\\
This does create a section in the table of contents. This means that
all following slides, until the next section, will be nested under
this section.
\item\option{tocsection=false}\\
This does not create a section in the table of contents and hence
the section will be listed as an ordinary slide.
\item\option{tocsection=hidden}\\
This does create a section in the table of contents, but this is
only visible when you view a slide that is part of this section.
This could be used to append a section to the presentation which you
can discuss if there is some extra time.
\end{description}

\DescribeOption{slide} This option controls whether the |\section|
command creates a slide. The preset value is |true|.
\begin{description}
\item\option{slide=true}\\
A slide is created.
\item\option{slide=false}\\
No slide will be created. If also |tocsection| is |false|, the
|\section| command doesn't do anything. If it does create a table of
contents section (|tocsection=| |true| or |hidden|), its link will
point to the first slide in the section as the section itself
doesn't have a slide.
\end{description}

\DescribeOption{template} This option can be used to make the
section slide with another template. By default, a normal |slide|
environment is used to create the section slide, but if a style
offers other templates that could be used for this purpose (for
instance, the |wideslide| environment), then you can use this option
to select that template. See section~\ref{sec:styles} for an
overview of the available templates with every style.

Finally, all options available to normal slides are available to
slides created by |\section| as well (see section~\ref{sec:slides}).
However, when the section does make a |tocsection|, |toc=| or |bm=|
won't remove the table of contents entry or the bookmark
respectively.

\subsection{Making an overview}\label{sec:tableofcontents}
\DescribeMacro{\tableofcontents}
This command creates an overview of your presentation and can only
be used on a slide.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{tableofcontents}\oarg{options}'
\end{command}
There are several \meta{options} to control the output of this
command.

\DescribeOption{type}
This option controls whether certain material (depending on the
input in the |content| option below) will be hidden or displayed in
the inactive color\index{inactive color|usage}. The preset value is
|0|. Compare with the |type| option for list environments
(section~\ref{sec:lists}).

\begin{description}
\item\option{type=0}\\
When material is not of the requested type as specified in the
|content| option, it will be hidden.
\item\option{type=1}\\
As |type=0|, but instead of hiding material, it will be typeset in
the inactive color.
\end{description}

\DescribeOption{content}
The |content| option controls which elements will be included in the
overview. The preset value is |all|. The description below assumes
that |type=0| was chosen, but the alternative text for |type=1| can
easily be deduced.

\begin{description}
\item\option{content=all}\\
This will display a full overview of your presentation including all
sections and slides, except the slides in hidden sections (see
section~\ref{sec:section}).
\item\option{content=sections}\\
This displays only the sections in the presentation.
\item\option{content=currentsection}\\
This displays the current section only.
\item\option{content=future}\\
This displays all content starting from the current slide.
\item\option{content=futuresections}\\
This displays all sections, starting from the current section.
\end{description}

We finish this section with a small example that will demonstrate
how you can make a presentation that contains an overall overview of
sections in the presentation, giving a general idea of the content,
and per section a detailed overview of the slides in that section.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}[toc=,bm=]{Overview}
   \tableofcontents[content=sections]
 \end{slide}
 \section{First section}
 \begin{slide}[toc=,bm=]{Overview of the first section}
   \tableofcontents[content=currentsection,type=1]
 \end{slide}
 \begin{slide}{Some slide}
 \end{slide}
 \section{Second section}
 ...
\end{example}

\section{Miscellaneous}
\subsection{Notes}\label{sec:notes}
\DescribeEnv{note}
The |note| environment can be used to make personal notes that
accompany a slide. You can control displaying notes using the
|display| option (see section~\ref{sec:classopts}). Here is an
example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Chewing gum}
 ...
 \end{slide}
 \begin{note}{Reminder for chewing gum}
   Don't forget to mention that chewing gum is sticky.
 \end{note}
\end{example}

\subsection{Empty slides}\label{sec:emptyslides}
\DescribeEnv{emptyslide}
The |emptyslide| environment creates a totally empty slide. The text
box on the slide can be used for special things like displaying
photos. This allows for creating a dia show. Example:
\begin{example}
 \begin{emptyslide}{}
   \centering
   \vspace{\stretch{1}}
   \includegraphics[height=0.8\slideheight]{me_chewing_gum.eps}
   \vspace{\stretch{1}}
 \end{emptyslide}
\end{example}
The |\includegraphics| command is defined by the \pf{graphicx}
package \cite{graphics}. The |\stretch| command is used to
vertically center the picture. Both commands are described in your
favorite \LaTeX\ manual, for instance \cite{companion}. Note that
you can use the lengths |\slideheight| and |\slidewidth| to scale
pictures to fit nicely on the slide.

\subsection{Bibliography slide}\label{sec:bib}
\DescribeEnv{thebibliography}
\pf{powerdot} redefines the standard \pf{article}
|thebibliography| environment to suppress the creation of a section
heading and running headers. All other properties are maintained.
You can do either of the next two (depending whether you are
using BiB\TeX\ or not):\\
\begin{minipage}[t]{.49\linewidth}
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Slide}
   \cite{someone}
  \end{slide}
\begin{slide}{References}
   \begin{thebibliography}{1}
   \bibitem{someone} Article of someone.
   \end{thebibliography}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.49\linewidth}
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Slide}
   \cite{someone}
 \end{slide}
 \begin{slide}{References}
   \bibliographystyle{plain}
   \bibliography{YourBib}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
\end{minipage}

In case you have a big reference list that you want to spread over
multiple slides, have a look at the packages \pf{natbib} and
\pf{bibentry} \cite{natbib}. Using both packages allows you to do:
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{References (1)}
   \bibliographystyle{plain}
   \nobibliography{YourBib}
   \bibentry{someone1}
   \bibentry{someone2}
 \end{slide}
 \begin{slide}{References (2)}
   \bibentry{someone3}
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Have a look at your favorite \LaTeX\ manual for more information
about citations and bibliographies.

\subsection{Verbatim on slides}\label{sec:verbatim}\DescribeOption{verbatim}
\pf{powerdot} has three different methods of processing slides, from
which two have mainly been developed to make the inclusion of
verbatim content\footnote{And other content that needs catcode
changes when processing.} on slides easier. These methods can be
accessed by the |method| key which is available in slide
environments and the |\pdsetup| command (see
section~\ref{sec:glopts}).
\begin{description}
\item\option{method=normal}\\
This is the preset method for processing slides. It is fast and
allows for overlays, but it does not allow for
verbatim.\footnote{Except when it has been saved in a box outside
the slide.}
\item\option{method=direct}\\
This method is also fast, but does not allow for overlays. Overlays
will silently be disabled. However, it does allow for verbatim
content on slides.
\item\option{method=file}\\
This method uses a temporary file to export the slide body to and
read it back in. This method does allow for verbatim content and
overlays, but could be slow when many slides use this method because
the filesystem is used.
\end{description}

Below is an example demonstrating the use of all three different
methods of slide processing.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass{powerdot}
 \usepackage{listings}
 \lstnewenvironment{code}{
   \lstset{frame=single,escapeinside=`',
   backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!20},
   basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily}
 }{}
 \begin{document}
 \begin{slide}{Slide 1}
 Normal \pause content.
 \end{slide}
 \begin{slide}[method=direct]{Slide 2}
 Steps 1 and 2:
 \begin{code}
 compute a;`\pause'
 compute b;
 \end{code}
 \end{slide}
 \begin{slide}[method=file]{Slide 3}
 Steps 1 and 2:
 \begin{code}
 compute a;`\pause'
 compute b;
 \end{code}
 \end{slide}
 \end{document}
\end{example}
The first slide shows the default behavior for normal content. It
produces two overlays. The second slide does not produce overlays,
despite the use of the |\pause| command. This command has been
disabled by choosing the |direct| method to process the verbatim
content. The third slide has the same body as the second slide, but
now does create two overlays, because the method using a temporary
file has been chosen. Notice that we used |\pause| inside the listing,
but that it can also be used outside the listing.

\subsection{The \cs{twocolumn} command}\label{sec:twocolumn}
\DescribeMacro{\twocolumn}
The |\twocolumn| macro allows to split content into two columns.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{twocolumn}\oarg{options}\marg{left}\marg{right}'
\end{command}
This typesets \meta{left} and \meta{right} in two columns. The
dimensions of those columns can be controlled by \meta{options}.
Below are the available options.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{lineheight}\option{lineheight}\\
If |lineheight| is specified, a line of the specified height will be
created using |\psline| in between the two columns. Example:
|lineheight=6cm|.
\item\DescribeOption{lineprop}\option{lineprop}\\
Any \pf{pstricks} declaration to specify the line properties. Example:
\begin{example}
 lineprop={linestyle=dotted,linewidth=3pt}
\end{example}
\item\DescribeOptions{lfrheight,lfrprop}\option{lfrheight,lfrprop}\\
The first creates a frame of the specified height around the left
column. The second is as |lineprop|, but for the left frame.
\item\DescribeOptions{rfrheight,rfrprop}\option{rfrheight,rfrprop}\\
As |lfrheight| and |lfrprop|, but for the right frame.
\item\DescribeOptions{lcolwidth,rcolwidth}\option{lcolwidth,rcolwidth}\\
Width of the left and right columns. Both are preset to: |0.47\linewidth|.
\item\DescribeOption{frsep}\option{frsep}\\
Space between text and the frames. Preset: |1.5mm|.
\item\DescribeOption{colsep}\option{colsep}\\
Space between the two columns. Preset: |0.06\linewidth|.
\item\DescribeOption{topsep}\option{topsep}\\
The extra space (additional to |\baselineskip|) between text above
the columns and the text within the columns. Preset: |0cm|.
\item\DescribeOption{bottomsep}\option{bottomsep}\\
Idem for the bottom of the columns. Preset: |0cm|.
\item\DescribeOption{indent}\option{indent}\\
Horizontal indent left to the left column. Preset: |0cm|.
\end{description}
The dimensions described above are represented graphically in

&|lineheight|&9&Reference point
\end{tabular}
\caption{Two-column dimensions.}\label{fig:twocolumndim}
\end{figure}
Important to notice is that the |\twocolumn| macro uses the current
cursor position as the reference point to position the first line of
text of the left column (see also figure \ref{fig:twocolumndim}). This
means that optional frames can extend to the text on the previous
line. Use for instance |topsep=0.3cm| in that case to add extra
space between the two lines of text. The preset value of |topsep|
is based on the situation that there is no text on top of the two
columns. In that case, it is best to locate the first line of text
of the left column at the same spot as text that is not created by
|\twocolumn| on other slides. The setting |topsep=0cm| does exactly
this. However, with a combination of |topsep| and |indent| you can
change this behavior and position the first line of text of the left
column anywhere you want.

The |\twocolumn| macro computes the height of the construction to
position text below the construction correctly. The computation is
done by taking the maximum height of |lfrheight|, |rfrheight|,
|lineheight| (if specified) and the left and right column content.
Hence when frames nor a line is requested, |bottomsep| is the
vertical space between the lowest line of text in the columns and
the text below the columns (additional to |\baselineskip|). Here is
an example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Two columns}
   Here are two columns.
   \twocolumn[
     lfrprop={linestyle=dotted,linewidth=3pt},
     lfrheight=4cm,rfrheight=5cm,lineheight=3cm,topsep=0.3cm
   ]{left}{right}
   Those were two columns.
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
Note that the use of the \pf{xkeyval} commands |\savevalue| and
|\usevalue| \index{savevalue=\verb!*+\savevalue+|usage}
\index{usevalue=\verb!*+\usevalue+|usage} could be handy here, for
instance for copying the properties of the left frame to the right
frame. This avoids typing them twice and avoids making errors
resulting in different frames. See an example below.
\begin{example}
 \twocolumn[
   \savevalue{lfrheight}=3cm,
   \savevalue{lfrprop}={
     linestyle=dotted,framearc=.2,linewidth=3pt},
   rfrheight=\usevalue{lfrheight},
   rfrprop=\usevalue{lfrprop}
 ]{left}{right}
\end{example}
See the \pf{xkeyval} documentation \cite{xkeyval} for more
information about |\savevalue| and |\usevalue|.

\section{Available styles}\label{sec:styles}
\pf{powerdot} comes with a number of styles which are listed in the
overview below. The characteristics of each style are described
shortly and a sample of a title slide and a normal slide is provided
for each style. Styles support the |wideslide| environment, have a
table of contents on the left part of the paper in landscape
orientation and on the bottom part in portrait orientation and
support portrait orientation unless states otherwise.
\begin{description}
\item\pf{default}\\
This style provides six different palettes. A flower in the top left
corner decorates the slides for all palettes. The default palette is
\texttt{blue} which has as main colors light blue and white. You can
see an example of that palette below. Other available palettes are
\texttt{red}, \texttt{green}, \texttt{yellow}, \texttt{brown} and
\texttt{purple}.\\
\styleexample{default}
\item\pf{simple}\\
This is a simple style in black and white. This style could be
useful if you want to print your slides.\\
\styleexample{simple}
\item\pf{tycja}\\
This style is set in shades of yellow and dark blue. The table of
contents on slides is on the right side of the paper in landscape
orientation and on the bottom part in portrait.\\
\styleexample{tycja}
\item\pf{ikeda}\\
This style uses dark shades of red and blue and a light text color.
It has nice patterns on the slide for decoration.\\
\styleexample{ikeda}
\item\pf{fyma}\\
This style was originally created by Laurent Jacques for
\pf{prosper}. Based on that style, he created a version for
\pf{HA-prosper} with extended features. With his kind permission,
this style has been converted by Shun'ichi J. Amano for
\pf{powerdot}. The style has an elegant design with a light blue and
white gradient background in the default \texttt{blue} palette.
Other available palettes are \texttt{green}, \texttt{gray},
\texttt{brown} and \texttt{orange}. It has special templates for
sections on slides and sections on wide slides. Below is a sample of
the blue palette.\\
\styleexample{fyma}
\item\pf{ciment}\\
This style was originally created by Mathieu Goutelle for
\pf{prosper} and \pf{HA-prosper}. With his kind permission, this style
has been converted for \pf{powerdot}. The style has a background
that is hatched with light gray horizontal lines. Titles and table
of contents highlighting are done with dark red.\\
\styleexample{ciment}
\item\pf{elcolors}\\
This is a style using light shades of the elementary colors red,
blue and yellow.\\
\styleexample{elcolors}
\item\pf{aggie}\\
This style was created by Jack Stalnaker for \pf{HA-prosper} and he
has converted this style for \pf{powerdot}. The style uses dark red
and light brown colors.\\
\styleexample{aggie}
\item\pf{husky}\\
This style is created by Jack Stalnaker and has a background of
light gray sun beams combined with dark red highlights.\\
\styleexample{husky}
\item\pf{sailor}\\
This style is contributed by Mael Hill\'ereau and supplies five
different palettes: \texttt{Sea} (the default), \texttt{River},
\texttt{Wine}, \texttt{Chocolate} and \texttt{Cocktail}. Below is a
sample of the palette \texttt{Sea}.\\
\styleexample{sailor}
\item\pf{upen}\\
This style has a nice dark blue background and text in yellow. It is
contributed by Piskala Upendran.\\
\styleexample{upen}
\item\pf{bframe}\\
The \pf{bframe} style has blue frames on the slide in which text is
positioned. The style is contributed by Piskala Upendran.\\
\styleexample{bframe}
\item\pf{horatio}\\
The \pf{horatio} style has been contributed by Michael Lundholm and
is a more conservative blue style.\\
\styleexample{horatio}
\item\pf{paintings}\\
This is a simple style without a table of contents on slides. It has
been contributed by Thomas Koepsell and provides 10 different
palettes. The colors used in the palettes are drawn from famous
paintings.\footnote{The style defines a color \texttt{pdcolor7}
which is not used in the style but comes from the same painting and
complements the other colors. It can be used, for example, to
highlight text against the main background color.} If you are
interested, open the style file to read which paintings have been
used. The available palettes are: \texttt{Syndics} (the default),
\texttt{Skater}, \texttt{GoldenGate}, \texttt{Lamentation},
\texttt{HolyWood}, \texttt{Europa}, \texttt{Moitessier},
\texttt{MayThird}, \texttt{PearlEarring} and \texttt{Charon} (all
case sensitive). Below is a sample of the \texttt{Syndics}
palette.\\
\styleexample{paintings}
\item\pf{klope}\\
The \pf{klope} style implements a horizontal table of contents that
only lists the sections. The style is available in the following
palettes: \texttt{Spring}, \texttt{PastelFlower}, \texttt{BlueWater}
and \texttt{BlackWhite}. The \texttt{Spring} palette is the default
and you can see a sample of that below.\\
\styleexample{klope}
\item\pf{jefka}\\
The \pf{jefka} style comes with four palettes: \texttt{brown} (the
default), \texttt{seagreen}, \texttt{blue} and \texttt{white}. Below
you see a sample of the \texttt{brown} palette.\\
\styleexample{jefka}
\item\pf{pazik}\\
This style is available in two palettes: \texttt{red} and
\texttt{brown}. Below is a sample of the default \texttt{red}
palette.\\
\styleexample{pazik}

\section{Compiling your presentation}\label{sec:compiling}
\subsection{Dependencies}\label{sec:dependencies}
In table \ref{tab:dependencies} is a list of packages that
\pf{powerdot} uses to perform specific tasks. Dependencies of
packages in this table are not listed. In the table, `required'
means that you should have a version \emph{at least} as new as
listed and `tested' means that \pf{powerdot} was tested with this
version, but that it could equally well work with an older or newer
version than the one listed in the table. So, when trying to solve
an error, first concentrate on solving version issues for the
`required' packages. To find out which version of a package you are
currently using, put |\listfiles| on the first line of your
document, run it with \LaTeX, open the |.log| file and read the file
list (see a \LaTeX\ manual for more information). If you need to
update a package, you can get it from CTAN \cite{CTAN}.
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{e}
Package/file & Version & Date & Required/tested\\\hline
\pf{xkeyval} \cite{xkeyval} & 2.5c & 2005/07/10 & required\\
\texttt{pstricks.sty} \cite{PSTricksWeb,PSTricks} & 0.2l & 2004/05/12 & required\\
\pf{xcolor} \cite{xcolor} & 1.11 & 2004/05/09 & required\\
\pf{enumitem} \cite{enumitem} & 1.0 & 2004/07/19 & required\\

\pf{verbatim} & 1.5q & 2003/08/22 & tested
\end{tabular}
\caption{Dependencies}\label{tab:dependencies}
\end{table}

\subsection{Creating and viewing output}\label{sec:creation}
To compile your presentation, run it with \LaTeX. The DVI that is
produced this way can be viewed with MiK\TeX's DVI viewer
YAP.\footnote{Unless you are using \pf{pstricks-add} which distorts
the coordinate system in DVI.} Unfortunately, xdvi and kdvi (kile)
do not support all PostScript specials and hence these will display
the presentation incorrectly. If your DVI viewer does support
this, make sure that your DVI display settings match that of the
presentation. In case you are using the |screen| paper, you should
set the DVI display setting to using the letter paper format. If
your DVI viewer allows for custom paper formats, use 8.25 inch by 11
inch.

Note that certain things that are produced with PostScript or PDF
techniques will not work in a DVI viewer. Examples are hiding of
material via postscript layers (as is done, for instance, by
|\pause|, see section~\ref{sec:overlays}) and hyperlinks, for
instance in the table of contents.

If you want to produce a postscript document, run dvips over the DVI
\emph{without any particular command line options related to
orientation or paper size}. \pf{powerdot} will write information to
the DVI file that helps dvips and ps2pdf (ghostscript) to create a
proper document. If you have some reason that this does not work for
you and you want to specify the paper and orientation yourself, you
should use the |nopsheader| option that is described in
section~\ref{sec:setup}. The PostScript document could, for
instance, be used to put multiple slides on a page using the |psnup|
utility.

To create a PDF document for your presentation, run ps2pdf over the
PS file created with dvips. Also here, you can \emph{leave out any
command line arguments related to paper size or orientation}. If
this is problematic for you somehow, use the |nopsheader| option as
before and specify the paper and orientation at each intermediate
step yourself.

\section{Creating your own style}\label{sec:writestyle}
\subsection{General information}
Writing or customizing \pf{powerdot} styles is simple. If you want
to modify a style or build a new one, locate the style that you want
to use as basis in your \TeX\ tree (styles are named as
|powerdot-<style_name>.sty|), copy that and rename it as to avoid
license\footnote{The \LaTeX\ Public Project License requires
renaming files when modifying them, see
\url{http://www.latex-project.org/lppl}.} or naming conflicts. You
might want to install the new style in your local \TeX\ tree to be
able to access it from any place on your hard drive. See your
\LaTeX\ distribution for more information.

Once that has been taken care of, we can start creating the style.
We strongly recommend to study a style file (for example,
|powerdot-default.sty|) while reading the remainder of this section
as it provides good examples for the content of this section.

A style has several components. We describe these components below.
\begin{description}
\item\textbf{Identification and packages}\\
This identifies the package in the log of a presentation and loads
all required packages. The \pf{default} style contains something like:
\begin{example}
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1995/12/01]
 \ProvidesPackage{powerdot-default}[2005/10/09 v1.2 default style (HA)]
 \RequirePackage{pifont}
\end{example}
See for more information about these commands a \LaTeX\ manual, for
instance \cite{companion}.
\item\textbf{Palette or color definitions}\\
This section contains the definitions of palettes or colors that you
want to use in the style. \pf{powerdot} uses \pf{xcolor} (via
\pf{pstricks}). Hence, for more information about colors, see the
\pf{xcolor} documentation. We will discuss palettes in more detail
in section~\ref{sec:defpals}.
\item\textbf{Template definitions}\\
We will come back to this in sections~\ref{sec:deftemps}
to~\ref{sec:defbg}.
\item\textbf{Custom declarations}\\
These can include anything that you want to be part of the style.
The \pf{default} style, for instance, includes definitions for the labels
in list environments like |itemize| and some initializations for
lists in general (done with |\pdsetup|, see
section~\ref{sec:pdsetup}). This part could also include some
customizations as described in section~\ref{sec:specialtemps}.
\item\textbf{Font initializations}\\
This initializes font definitions (which can be done by
loading a package like \pf{helvet}).
\end{description}

\subsection{Defining palettes}\label{sec:defpals}
We will be defining templates formally in
section~\ref{sec:deftemps}. For now, it's enough to have the general
idea that a template controls the design of a slide. Palettes are
sets of colors that color a template or design. A palette does not
change the overall design of a template.

\DescribeMacro{\pddefinepalettes}
The following command can be used to define palettes for your style.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{pddefinepalettes}\marg{name1}\marg{cmds1}\dots'
\end{command}
This macro takes \emph{any} even number of mandatory arguments with
a minimum of two. For every \meta{name}, a set of \meta{commands}
can be given which define the palette with name \meta{name}. These
commands can define colors with names |pdcolor1|, |pdcolor2|,
etcetera. These colors can be used when designing the template (see
section~\ref{sec:deftemps}). |pdcolor1| will always be used as text
color.

The user can access these palettes via the |palette| key for the
|\pdsetup| command (see section~\ref{sec:pdsetup}). If the user does
not specify a palette, the first palette defined when compiling the
presentation, will be used. Here is an example for defining 2
palettes.
\begin{example}
 \pddefinepalettes{reds}{
   \definecolor{pdcolor1}{rgb}{1,0,0}
   \definecolor{pdcolor2}{rgb}{1,.1,0}
   \definecolor{pdcolor3}{rgb}{1,.2,0}
 }{greens}{
   \definecolor{pdcolor1}{rgb}{0,1,0}
   \definecolor{pdcolor2}{rgb}{.1,1,0}
   \definecolor{pdcolor3}{rgb}{.2,1,0}
 }
\end{example}
In this example, the |reds| palette is the default one. For more
information about |\definecolor|, see the documentation of the
\pf{xcolor} package \cite{xcolor}.

Notice that it is not necessary to use the names |pdcolor2|,
|pdcolor3| etcetera as color names. But if these colors are defined,
\pf{powerdot} will use them, for instance, in the random dots
feature (see section~\ref{sec:glopts}). The flexibility adds extra
possibilities in setting up templates and palettes. See for an
example of its use, the \pf{klope} style.

\subsection{Defining templates}\label{sec:deftemps}
We start off with a definition of what a template is. A template is
a collection of settings for slide components together with custom
definitions, which controls the visual appearance of a slide. A
style can contain multiple templates.

\begin{command}
 `\cs{pddefinetemplate}\oarg{basis}\marg{name}\marg{options}\marg{commands}'
\end{command}
\DescribeMacro{\pddefinetemplate}
This defines the environment \meta{name} to produce a slide with
characteristics determined by \meta{basis}, \meta{options} and
\meta{commands}. We will discuss these elements in more detail
in the coming sections.

If you want to create several templates that differ only slightly
from each other, define a \meta{basis} template, and then use it to
define other templates. All \meta{options} and \meta{commands} for
the new template \meta{name} will be appended to the existing list
of \meta{options} and \meta{commands} from the \meta{basis}
template.

Make sure you choose a \emph{proper} name for the template, and
avoid redefining existing templates or environments. \pf{powerdot}
defines |pauseslide|, |note| and |emptyslide| internally, so you
shouldn't use these names unless you know what you're doing.
Furthermore, each style needs to define at least the templates
|slide| and |titleslide|. The |titleslide| environment will be used
to create the title slide and |slide| will (by default) also be used
to create section slides. Titles and sections are a bit special in
the way they use the \meta{options} and will be discussed in more
detail in section~\ref{sec:specialtemps}.

\subsection{Controlling setup}
\DescribeOption{ifsetup}
The \meta{options} (keys) are described in the following sections.
You can control how these options apply to the various setups by
using the |ifsetup| key. Any key appearing before the first
|ifsetup| declaration in \meta{options} will apply to every possible
setup. Once the |ifsetup| key is used, then all subsequent key
declarations will apply \textit{only} to the setups declared in the
|ifsetup| key. The |ifsetup| key can be used multiple times.

By possible setups, we mean the allowed values of the |mode|,
|paper|, |orient|, and |display| keys that are described in
section~\ref{sec:classopts}. If a value (or values!) for any of
these four keys is not specified in a |ifsetup| declaration, then
all subsequent key declarations will apply to any layout of that
type. Consider the following as an example.
\begin{example}[numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny\ttfamily,
  escapeinside=`',numbersep=1em,xleftmargin=1em]
 ...
 textpos={.2\slidewidth,.3\slideheight},
 ifsetup={portrait,screen},
 textpos={.3\slidewidth,.2\slideheight}
 ...
 ifsetup=landscape,
 ...
 ifsetup,
 ...
\end{example}
Assuming there was no |ifsetup| declaration before the first
|textpos| declaration, this first |textpos| will apply to every
possible setup. However, for the screen format in portrait
orientation, the next |textpos| declaration will be used. In fact,
all declarations that appear until we switch to the next |ifsetup|
(which specifies all paper sorts and only landscape orientation)
will be used in the portrait screen layout. All keys after the next
|ifsetup| declaration will be used in landscape orientation,
\emph{with any paper, mode and display}. If, after declaring some
specializations, you want to switch back to settings that apply to
all possible setups, set |ifsetup| to empty as is done in the
example. All subsequent declarations will then again be applied
under any setup.

The following command is a stand-alone implementation of the
mechanism described above. It allows you to control the setup
outside the \meta{options} argument of the |\pddefinetemplate|
command.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{pdifsetup}\marg{desired}\marg{true}\marg{false}'
\end{command}
\DescribeMacro{\pdifsetup}
This macro executes \meta{true} when the setup that the user chose
matches with the \meta{desired} setup, \meta{false} in all other cases.
For instance, if the user has chosen landscape, then
\begin{example}
 \pdifsetup{landscape}{yes}{no}
\end{example}
will typeset |yes|. If the user would have chosen portrait instead,
then |no| would have been typeset.

This macro can be used to check setup requests from the user and,
for instance, generate an error if a certain setup is not supported
by your style. \pf{powerdot} provides one predefined error message
which can be used in one of the first lines of your style.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{pd@noportrait}'
\end{command}
\DescribeMacro{\pd@noportrait}
This macro generates an error when the user requests portrait
orientation. Notice that the handout mode only works in portrait
orientation. This macro takes that into account and doesn't generate
an error in the case that the user requested a handout.

\subsection{Main components}\label{sec:maincomps}
The \meta{options} control several key components of a slide. Every
component has several properties. A key that can be used in the
\meta{options} argument is the name of the component postfixed by
its property that you want to control.

The components |title|, |text|, |toc|, |stoc| and |ntoc| have
properties |hook|, |pos|, |width| and |font|. Additionally, the
|text| component has a |height| property. The components |lf|, |cf| and
|rf| have properties |hook|, |pos|, |temp| and |font|. Hence,
examples of valid keys are |titlefont|, |tocpos| and |lftemp|. All
components and properties will be discussed below.

Here is an overview of the components that can be controlled from
the \meta{options} argument in |\pddefinetemplate|.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{title-}\option{title-}\\
The slide title.
\item\DescribeOption{text-}\option{text-}\\
The main text box on the slide.
\item\DescribeOption{toc-}\option{toc-}\\
The (full) table of contents on a slide containing sections and
slides.
\item\DescribeOption{stoc-}\option{stoc-}\\
This is a table of contents containing only the sections. See also
|ntoc| below.
\item\DescribeOption{ntoc-}\option{ntoc-}\\
This is a table of contents containing only the entries for the
active section. Together with |stoc|, this can be used to create a
split table of contents. In a particular template, one would usually
have a |toc|, a combination of |stoc| and |ntoc| or no table of
contents at all.
\item\DescribeOptions{lf-,cf-,rf-}\option{lf-,cf-,rf-}\\
The left, center and right footers.
\end{description}

Notice that all positioning of components described above will be
done with |\rput| from \pf{pstricks} \cite{PSTricksWeb,PSTricks}
internally. See the \pf{pstricks} documentation for more information
about this command. It should also be noted that all components
(except |lf|, |cf| and |rf|) put their content in a |minipage|
environment.

Now we list all properties of the components listed above and
describe what they mean. Remember that keys are formed by combining
a component name and a property.

\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{-hook}\option{-hook}\\
This option defines the |\rput| hook that will be used when
positioning the item. This can be |tl|, |t|, |tr|, |r|, |Br|, |br|,
|b|, |bl|, |Bl|, |l|, |B| and |c|. See the \pf{pstricks}
documentation for more information.
\item\DescribeOption{-pos}\option{-pos}\\
This defines the position of the |hook| on the paper. The lower left
corner of the paper is given by the point |{0,0}| and the upper right
corner by the point |{\slidewidth,\slideheight}|. So if you want to
position the main text box at 20\% from the left edge and 30\% from
the top edge of the paper, you have to do the following.
\begin{example}
 textpos={.2\slidewidth,.7\slideheight}
\end{example}
If the position of any component has not been specified, this
component will not be placed on the slide. This gives an opportunity
to design slides without footers or table of contents, for instance.
\item\DescribeOption{-width}\option{-width}\\
The width of the component. All component positioned by
\pf{powerdot} will be put in a surrounding |minipage| environment.
The |width| property determines the width of the |minipage|. Example:
\begin{example}
 textwidth=.7\slidewidth
\end{example}
This property does not exist for the |lf|, |cf| and |rf| components.
\item\DescribeOption{-height}\option{-height}\\
This option is only available for the |text| component. In other
words, for this property, there is only one key, namely
|textheight|. This can be used to specify the height of the
|minipage| used for the main text. This does not imply that users
are restricted to this length or that \pf{powerdot} does automatic
slide breaking. This height is only used for vertical alignments of
material, for instance by footnotes. The preset value is
|\slideheight|.
\item\DescribeOption{-font}\option{-font}\\
This will be inserted just before the text that is about to be
typeset. This can be used to declare deviations from the main text
font and color. It can be a font declaration, like
|\large\bfseries|, but can also contain other things like
|\color{red}| or |\raggedright|.
\item\DescribeOption{-temp}\option{-temp}\\
This property is only available for the footers (|lf|, |cf| and |rf|) and
can be used to change the template of the footers. This means that
you can, for instance, add content to the footer, besides the
content specified by the user. The default declaration by
\pf{powerdot} is the following.
\begin{example}
 rftemp=\pd@@rf\ifx\pd@@rf\@empty
   \else\ifx\theslide\@empty\else\ -- \fi\fi\theslide
\end{example}
Here |\pd@@rf| will contain the content of the right footer defined
by the user via the |\pdsetup| command. Similarly, |\pd@@lf|
contains the content of the left footer. The above declaration
checks whether the footer and |\theslide| are both non-empty and if
so, it inserts | -- | to separate both.
\item\DescribeOption{-orient}\option{-orient}\\
This property is only available for the |toc|, |stoc| and |ntoc|
components. This property can be |h| or |v| and determines the
orientation of the table of contents. The preset is |v|. See
also section~\ref{sec:slidetoc} for more information about the
construction of the table of contents.
\end{description}

\subsection{Slide toc}\label{sec:slidetoc}
The small table of contents that is placed on slides can be
controlled by four macros and several options.

\DescribeMacro{\pd@tocslide}
\DescribeMacro{\pd@tocsection}
These macros take one argument. When building the table of contents,
\pf{powerdot} first passes the content through |\pd@tocslide| or
|\pd@tocsection|, depending on the type of entry that it is building
at that moment. You could, for instance, do
\begin{example}
 \def\pd@tocslide#1{$\bullet$\ #1}
 \def\pd@tocsection#1{#1}
\end{example}
which will prefix all normal entries (not the sections) with a
bullet. By default, these two macros are defined to just pass on
their argument.

\DescribeMacro{\pd@tocdisplay}
\DescribeMacro{\pd@tochighlight}
These two macros also take one argument. After processing an entry
with the command |\pd@tocslide| or |\pd@tocsection|, \pf{powerdot}
continues building the entry by passing it through |\pd@tocdisplay|,
when the entry needs to be displayed only, or |\pd@tochighlight|,
when the entry needs to be highlighted. These macros are a little
more involved and take care of putting the content in the proper
font and color in a |minipage|. Further, |\pd@tochighlight| also
puts a box around the item.

Notice, that by default, both the separate table of contents entries
as well as the table of contents as a whole are typeset in
|minipage| environments by these macros, in case the table of
contents is vertical. The |-width| properties then determines the
width of the table of contents and, together with |tocsecindent| and
|tocslideindent| (see below) the width of the individual entries. If
it is horizontal, only the separate entries will be in |minipage|s
and the table of contents itself not and the |-width| properties
determine only the width of the individual entries (together with
|tocsecindent| and |tocslideindent|).

Several aspects of the process of generating the table of contents
can be controlled via the keys that are available in the
|\pddefinetemplate| command that will be described below. If these
keys do not provide enough handles to do what you want, you might
need to have a look at the two macros in the source and decide to
rewrite them in your style as to fit your needs. An example can be
found in the \pf{fyma} style.

\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{tocfrsep}\option{tocfrsep}\\
This length is the distance between the box around the content
created by the |minipage| and the highlight frame box created by
|\pd@tochighlight|. Preset: |0.5mm|.
\item\DescribeOption{tocsecsep}\option{tocsecsep}\\
The distance inserted before a section (unless it is the
first element in the table of contents). Preset: |2ex|.
Notice that if the orientation of the table of contents is set to
vertical, this length creates a vertical skip, otherwise, it creates
a horizontal skip.
\item\DescribeOption{tocslidesep}\option{tocslidesep}\\
The distance inserted before other entries (unless it is the
first element in the table of contents). Preset: |0ex|. Like
|tocsecsep|, the effect of this length depends on the orientation of
the table of contents.
\item\DescribeOption{tocsecindent}\option{tocsecindent}\\
The horizontal space left to a section entry. Preset: |0pt|.
\item\DescribeOption{tocslideindent}\option{tocslideindent}\\
The horizontal space left to a slide entry. The horizontal skip will
not be inserted left to slide entries that appear before the first
section. Preset: |0pt|.
\item\DescribeOption{tocsecm}\option{tocsecm}\\
This is inserted just before typesetting a section. This can be used
to mark a section, for instance with a line as in the \pf{default}
style. Preset: empty.
\item\DescribeOption{toctcolor}\option{toctcolor}\\
This is the text color used for non-highlighted elements in the
table of contents. Preset: |black|.
\item\DescribeOption{tochltcolor}\option{tochltcolor}\\
This is the text color used for highlighted elements in the table of
contents. Preset: |white|.
\item\DescribeOption{tochlcolor}\option{tochlcolor}\\
This is the color used for the frame behind highlighted elements.
Preset: |black|.
\end{description}

\subsection{Miscellaneous options}\label{sec:miscoptions}
There are some options that fall outside of the scope of the previous
sections. These will be discussed here.

\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOption{iacolor}\option{iacolor}\\
The |iacolor| option can be used to specify the color that is used
for inactive things, produced for instance by |\onslide|, |\pause|
(see section~\ref{sec:overlays}) and |\tableofcontents| (see
section~\ref{sec:tableofcontents}). As \pf{xcolor} is used by
\pf{powerdot}, one can use special notation here, like
\begin{example}
 iacolor=black!20
\end{example}
The preset value for this key is |lightgray|.
\end{description}

The following options control the digital clock (see
section~\ref{sec:classopts}). The clock is a form text field with
dynamic content, driven by a javascript via \pf{hyperref} text
fields. Some options for the clock work similarly as for, for
instance, the title component, but there are also special options.
\begin{description}
\item\DescribeOptions{clockhook,clockpos}\option{clockhook,clockpos}\\
These work in the same way as the |-hook| and |-pos| properties
discussed in section~\ref{sec:maincomps}. The preset value of
|clockhook| is |tr|.
\item\DescribeOptions{clockwidth,clockheight}\option{clockwidth,clockheight}\\
These control the width and height of the text field containing the
clock. Preset values come from \pf{hyperref} and are |3cm| and
|\baselineskip|, respectively.
\item\DescribeOption{clockcharsize}\option{clockcharsize}\\
The size of characters of the clock. Preset: |14pt|.
\item\DescribeOption{clockalign}\option{clockalign}\\
The alignment of the clock in the text field. |0| is left-aligned,
|1| is centered and |2| is right aligned. Preset is |2|.
\item\DescribeOption{clockcolor}\option{clockcolor}\\
This determines the text color of the clock. The value should be a
named color. The preset value is |black|.
\end{description}

\subsection{Template presets}
Below, we have copied the preset setting for the keys described
above. These will be used if you didn't supply other input for these
keys in a particular template. If the preset value meets your
needs, you don't have to specify it again in your style.
\begin{example}
 titlehook=Bl,titlepos=,titlewidth=\slidewidth,
 titlefont=\raggedright,texthook=tl,textpos=,
 textwidth=\slidewidth,textfont=\raggedright,
 textheight=\slideheight,
 tochook=tl,tocpos=,tocwidth=.2\slidewidth,
 tocfont=\tiny\raggedright,
 stochook=tl,stocpos=,stocwidth=.2\slidewidth,
 stocfont=\tiny\raggedright,
 ntochook=tl,ntocpos=,ntocwidth=.2\slidewidth,
 ntocfont=\tiny\raggedright,
 tocorient=v,stocorient=v,ntocorient=v,
 tocfrsep=.5mm,tocsecsep=2ex,tocslidesep=0ex,
 tocsecm=,toctcolor=black,tochlcolor=black,tochltcolor=white,
 tocsecindent=0pt,tocslideindent=0pt,
 lfhook=Bl,lfpos=,lffont=\scriptsize,lftemp=\pd@@lf,
 cfhook=B,cfpos=,cffont=\scriptsize,cftemp=\pd@@cf,
 rfhook=Br,rfpos=,rffont=\scriptsize,rftemp=\pd@@rf\ifx\pd@@rf
   \@empty\else\ifx\theslide\@empty\else\ -- \fi\fi\theslide,
 iacolor=lightgray,
 clockhook=tr,clockpos=,clockwidth=3cm,clockheight=\baselineskip,
 clockcharsize=14pt,clockalign=2,clockcolor=black
\end{example}

\subsection{The background}\label{sec:defbg}
This leaves only one argument of the |\pddefinetemplate| macro
undiscussed. This is the \meta{commands} argument. This argument can
contain any code that you want to execute \textit{after} setting the
options and \textit{before} building the slide components like the
slide title, main text, and footers. This argument is designed to
contain declarations that will build the background of a template
using, for instance, \pf{pstricks}, but it can also hold other
commands you might need for building your template.

Important to notice is that these commands may not create \TeX\
material as that might destroy the construction of the slide. So, if
you want to place the word `Hello' in the bottom left corner of the
slide, don't type `Hello', but make its width, height and depth
equal to zero, for instance by using \pf{pstricks}' |\rput|.
\begin{example}
 \rput[bl](0,0){Hello}
\end{example}

\subsection{Title slide, titles and sections}\label{sec:specialtemps}
As mentioned before, the style that you write needs to define at
least the templates |slide| and |titleslide|. The latter treats some
of the keys in a special way. Besides, a section slide is also done
in a special way.

The title slide (made with |\maketitle|) puts the title with
author(s) and date in the main text box. This means that you have to
supply a position for the main text box (|textpos|). It will use the
main text font for the text (together with declarations in the
|textfont| key) for the author(s) and the date. But it will use the
declarations in |titlefont| for the title of the presentation. This
is done so that title and author(s) form a coherent block and to
make sure that long titles can push down the author(s) instead of
overwriting it.

\DescribeMacro{\pd@slidetitle}
The |\pd@slidetitle| macro is used to typeset the slide title on
slides. This macro is comparable to for instance |\pd@tocslide|. The
macro takes one argument which is the slide title in the right font
and formatting. By default, this macro just passes on the content
for typesetting, but you could redefine this macro so do something
with its input prior to typesetting it. An example is in the
\pf{fyma} style which underlines the title after putting it in a
|minipage| to support multi line titles.

\DescribeMacros{\pd@title,\pd@sectiontitle}
These macros are similar to |\pd@slidetitle| and typeset the title
on the title slide and the title on section slides respectively. By
default, these also pass there argument (which is the presentation
title or section title), but these can be redefined to do something
with the input prior to typesetting it, just as |\pd@slidetitle|.

\DescribeOptions{sectemp,widesectemp}
The |\section| command uses (by default) the |slide| environment and
puts the section title in the title box with font |titlefont|. If
you want to change the default use of the |slide| environment for
sections to, for instance, the |sectionslide| environment or any
other especially designed section template, change the section
template preset in your style, using
\begin{example}
 \setkeys[pd]{section}{sectemp=sectionslide}
\end{example}
This means that if the user asks for |template=slide| in the
|\section| command, the |sectionslide| environment will be used
silently. To avoid surprises, |sectionslide| should preferably be
based on the |slide| environment.

A similar option is available in case the user asks for
|template=wideslide|. One could for instance do the following.
\begin{example}
 \setkeys[pd]{section}{widesectemp=sectionwideslide}
\end{example}
Whenever the user requests a |wideslide| to be used for a
|\section|, instead, the |sectionwideslide| environment will be
used. Other input to the |template| key by the user does not get a
special treatment.

Notice that these keys are available in the |section| family of keys
and that you cannot use them in the |\pddefinetemplate| command.

\subsection{Testing the style}\label{sec:styletest}
\pf{powerdot} has a test file that should test most of the style.
This test file can be produced by running \LaTeX\ over
|powerdot.dtx|. This generates |powerdot-styletest.tex| which will
help you with the testing job. Feel free to contact us when you
would like to contribute your style to \pf{powerdot}. See also
section~\ref{sec:questions}.

\section{Using \LyX\ for presentations}\label{sec:lyx}
\LyX\ \cite{LyXWeb} is a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)
document processor based on \LaTeX. It supports standard \LaTeX\
classes but needs special files, called layout files, in order to
support non-standard classes such as \pf{powerdot}.

To start using \LyX\ for \pf{powerdot} presentations, copy the
layout file |powerdot.layout| to the \LyX\ layout directory. You can
find this file in the doc tree of your \LaTeX\ installation:
\url{texmf/doc/latex/powerdot}. If you can't find it there, download
it from \url{CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/powerdot}. Once that is
done, reconfigure \LyX\ (\texttt{Edit\LyXarrow Reconfigure} and
restart \LyX\ afterwards). Now you can use the \pf{powerdot}
document class as any other supported class. Go to
\texttt{Layout\LyXarrow Document} and select \texttt{powerdot
presentation} as document class. For more information, see the \LyX\
documentation, which is accessible from the |Help| menu.

\subsection{How to use the layout}
The \pf{powerdot} \LyX\ layout provides some environments\footnote{Don't
confuse these with \LaTeX\ environments.} which can be used in \LyX.
Some of these environments (for instance |Title| or |Itemize|) are
natural to use since they exist also in the standard document
classes such as \pf{article}. For more information on these standard
environments, see the \LyX\ documentation.

This section will explain how to use the \pf{powerdot} specific
environments |Slide|, |WideSlide|, |EmptySlide| and |Note|. These
environments correspond to the \pf{powerdot} environments |slide|,
|emptyslide|, |wideslide| and |note|.

We start with a simple example. The following \LaTeX\ code
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{Slide title}
   Slide content.
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
can be obtained using the following \LyX\ environments. The right
column represents the text typed into the \LyX\ window and the left
column represents the environment applied to this text).
\begin{example}
 Slide         Slide title
 Standard      Slide content.
 EndSlide
\end{example}
Some remarks concerning this example.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt]
\item You can use the environment menu (under the menu bar, top-left
corner) to change the environment applied to text.
\item The slide title should be typed on the line of the |Slide|
environment.
\item |EndSlide| finishes the slide and its line is left blank.
\end{itemize}

In the \LyX\ window, the |Slide| environment (that is, the slide
title) is displayed in magenta, the |WideSlide| style in green, the
|EmptySlide| style in cyan and the |Note| style in red and hence
these are easily identifiable.

Here is another example.
\begin{example}
 \begin{slide}{First slide title}
   The first slide.
 \end{slide}
 \begin{note}{First note title}
   The first note, concerning slide 1.
 \end{note}
 \begin{slide}{Second slide title}
   The second slide.
 \end{slide}
\end{example}
This can be done in \LyX\ in the following way.
\begin{example}
 Slide         First slide title
 Standard      The first slide.
 Note          First note title
 Standard      The first note, concerning slide 1.
 Slide         Second slide title
 Standard      The second slide.
 EndSlide
\end{example}
This example demonstrates that it is often sufficient to insert the
|EndSlide| style after the last slide or note only. Only when you
want certain material not to be part of a slide, you need to finish
the preceding slide manually using the |EndSlide| style. Example:
\begin{example}
 Slide         First slide title
 Standard      The first slide.
 EndSlide
 [ERT box with some material]
 Slide         Second slide title
 ...
\end{example}

Options can be passed to slide environments by using
\texttt{Insert\LyXarrow Short title} in front of the slide title.
The following example uses the |direct| method (see
section~\ref{sec:verbatim}) in the short title argument (delimited by
square brackets) to allow for a |lstlisting| environment (defined by
the \pf{listings} package) within the slide content.
\begin{example}
 Slide         [method=direct]Example of LaTeX source code
 Standard      Here's the \HelloWorld command:
 [ERT box:
   \lstset{language=[LaTeX]TeX}
   \begin{lstlisting}
   \newcommand{\HelloWorld}{Hello World!}
   \end{lstlisting}
 ]
 EndSlide
\end{example}
Note that you are not obliged to use a |verbatim| environment to
type the |\HelloWord| text into the \LyX\ window because \LyX\
directly supports standard verbatim.\footnote{\LyX\ translates
special characters into their corresponding \LaTeX\ command. For
instance, the backslash character is translated into
\cs{textbackslash{}}. Resulting, the font is not the same as in true
verbatim and you might want to change that via the
\texttt{Layout\LyXarrow Character} dialog.} Consequently, the use of
the slide processing methods |direct| and |file| is not necessary
when you need standard verbatim, but it is necessary when doing more
advanced things, like in the example above.

\subsection{Support of syntax}
This section lists options, commands and environments that are
supported through the \LyX\ interface directly, without using an ERT
box (\TeX-mode).

All class options (see section~\ref{sec:classopts}) are supported
via the \texttt{Layout\LyXarrow Document} dialog (|Layout| pane).
Options for the |\pdsetup| command (see section~\ref{sec:setup})
should be specified in the |Preamble| pane of the
\texttt{Layout\LyXarrow Document} dialog.

Table \ref{tab:lyxcommands} lists the \pf{powerdot} commands that
are supported in \LyX.
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{f}
Command & Method in \LyX\\\hline
\cs{title} & Use \texttt{Title} environment.\\
\cs{author} & Use \texttt{Author} environment.\\
\cs{date} & Use \texttt{Date} environment.\\
\cs{maketitle} & Managed directly by \LyX.\\
\cs{section} & Use the \texttt{Section} environment. Options to this
command (see section~\ref{sec:section}) can be specified using
\texttt{Insert\LyXarrow Short title} in front of the section title.\\
\cs{tableofcontents} & Use \texttt{Insert\LyXarrow Lists \&
TOC\LyXarrow Table of contents}. You will need an ERT box if you
want to use the optional argument, see below.
\end{tabular}
\caption{Supported \pf{powerdot} commands in \LyX}\label{tab:lyxcommands}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:lyxenvs} lists the \pf{powerdot} environments that,
besides the earlier discussed |slide|, |wideslide|, |note| and
|emptyslide| environments, are supported in \LyX.
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{f}
Environment & Method in \LyX\\\hline
\texttt{itemize} & Use \texttt{Itemize} and \texttt{ItemizeType1}
environments. The latter will create a list with |type=1| (see
section~\ref{sec:lists}).\\
\texttt{enumerate} & Use \texttt{Enumerate} and
\texttt{EnumerateType1} environments.\\
\texttt{thebibliography} & Use \texttt{Bibliography} environment.
\end{tabular}
\caption{Supported \pf{powerdot} environments in \LyX}\label{tab:lyxenvs}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:lyxERT} lists commands that can only be done by using
an ERT box (via \texttt{Insert\LyXarrow TeX}).
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{f}
Command & Method in \LyX\\\hline
\cs{and} & Within \texttt{Author} environment.\\
\cs{pause} & \\
\cs{item} & An ERT box is only required for the optional argument,
not mandatory for overlays specifications.\\
\cs{onslide} & And the versions \cs{onslide+} and \cs{onslide*}.\\
\cs{twocolumn} & \\
\cs{tableofcontents} & Only when using the optional argument.
\end{tabular}
\caption{\pf{powerdot} commands needing an ERT box in \LyX}\label{tab:lyxERT}
\end{table}
Note that you may use the clipboard in order to repeat often used
commands like |\pause|. Finally, table \ref{tab:lyxadd} lists
additional commands and environments that are supported by the layout.
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{f}
Env./Command & Method in \LyX\\\hline
\texttt{quote} & Use \texttt{Quote} environment.\\
\texttt{quotation} & Use \texttt{Quotation} environment.\\
\texttt{verse} & Use \texttt{Verse} environment.\\
\cs{caption} & Use \texttt{Caption} environment within standard
float environments.
\end{tabular}
\caption{Additional environments for \LyX}\label{tab:lyxadd}
\end{table}

\subsection{Compiling with \LyX}
First of all, make sure that you have also read
section~\ref{sec:compiling}. Then, in order to get a proper
PostScript or PDF file, you have to set your \LyX\ document
properties depending on which paper and orientation you want. When
your \LyX\ document is open, go to the \texttt{Layout\LyXarrow
Document} dialog. In the \texttt{Layout} pane, put the |nopsheader|,
|orient| and |paper| keys as class options (see
section~\ref{sec:classopts} for a description). Then, go to the
|Paper| pane and select corresponding paper size and orientation
(you may choose |letter| paper in the case you set |paper=screen| in
the class options). Finally, go to the |View| (or
\texttt{File\LyXarrow Export}) menu and select your output
(PostScript or PDF).

\subsection{Extending the layout}
If you have created a custom style (see section~\ref{sec:writestyle})
which defines custom templates, you may want to extend the layout
file\footnote{The LPPL dictates to rename a file if you modify it as
to avoid confusion.} so that these templates are also supported in
\LyX. The explanation below assumes that you have defined a template
called |sunnyslide|.

To support this new template in \LyX, you have to use the following
command.
\begin{command}
 `\cs{pddefinelyxtemplate}\meta{cs}\marg{template}'
\end{command}
\DescribeMacro{\pddefinelyxtemplate}
This will define the control sequence \meta{cs} such that it will
create a slide with template \meta{template} (which has been defined
using |\pddefinetemplate|. This new control sequence can be used in
the layout file as follows.
\begin{example}
 # SunnySlide environment definition
 Style SunnySlide
   CopyStyle     Slide
   LatexName     lyxend\lyxsunnyslide
   Font
     Color       Yellow
   EndFont
   Preamble
     \pddefinelyxtemplate\lyxsunnyslide{sunnyslide}
   EndPreamble
 End
\end{example}
Note that you must begin the |LatexName| field with |lyxend|. The
definition of the \LyX\ template has been inserted in between
|Preamble| and |EndPreamble| which assures that the new \LyX\
environment will work in every presentation. After modifying the
layout file, don't forget to restart \LyX. See for more information
about creating \LyX\ environments, the documentation of \LyX\ in the
|Help| menu.

\section{Questions}\label{sec:questions}
\subsection{Frequently Asked Questions}\label{sec:FAQ}
This section is devoted to Frequently Asked Questions. Please read
it carefully; your problem might be solved by this section.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0pt]
\question
Does \pf{powerdot} have example files? Where can I find them?
\answer
\pf{powerdot} comes with several examples that should be in the doc
tree of your \LaTeX\ installation. More precisely:
\url{texmf/doc/latex/powerdot}. If you can't find them there,
download them from \url{CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/powerdot}
\cite{CTAN}.
\question I'm getting errors or unexpected output when compiling
the simplest example!
\answer Did you read section~\ref{sec:compiling}?
\question I made a typo in the slide code, ran the file, got an
error, corrected the typo and reran, but now get an error that
doesn't go away.
\answer Remove the |.bm| and |.toc| files and try again.
\question |\pause| does not work in the |align|\footnote{There are
several environments doing similar things as \texttt{align}. Another
example is the \texttt{split} environment, but more (often from the
\pf{amsmath} package) can cause similar trouble for \cs{pause}.}
environment.
\answer |align| does several tricky things, which make it impossible
to use |\pause|. Use |\onslide| instead. See
section~\ref{sec:onslide}.
\question My \pf{pstricks} nodes appear on all overlays. Also: color
doesn't seem to work with |\onslide|.
\answer Some PostScript tricks like nodes and color do not work with
|\onslide|. Use |\onslide*| instead. See an example below.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass{powerdot}
 \usepackage{pst-node}
 \begin{document}
 \begin{slide}{Color}
 \onslide*{2}{\cnode(0,-5pt){2pt}{A}}
 This is {\onslide*{2-}{\color{red}} red} text.
 \onslide*{2}{\cnode(0,-5pt){2pt}{B}}
 \onslide{2}{\ncline{A}{B}}
 \end{slide}
 \end{document}
\end{example}
\question Do I need to edit style files to change a style a bit?
\answer No, you do not need to edit any style file. You can change
any part of a certain style using the |\pddefinetemplate| and
|\pddefinepalettes| commands. Here is an example that removes the
left and right footers from the \pf{default} style, places the slide
number in the center footer and adds another palette.
\begin{example}
 \documentclass{powerdot}
 \pddefinetemplate[slide]{slide}{
   lfpos=,rfpos=,cftemp=\theslide
 }{}
 \pddefinepalettes{mypalette}{
   \definecolor{pdcolor1}{rgb}{.27,.31,.44}
   \definecolor{pdcolor2}{rgb}{.85,.85,.92}
   \definecolor{pdcolor3}{rgb}{.8,.75,.98}
 }
 \pdsetup{palette=mypalette}
 \begin{document}
 \begin{slide}{Title}
 \end{slide}
 \end{document}
\end{example}
See section~\ref{sec:writestyle} for more information about these
two commands.
\question Can I contribute to this project?
\answer
Certainly. If you find bugs\footnote{Make sure that you confirm that
the bug is really caused by \pf{powerdot} and not by another package
that you use.} or typos, please send a message to the mailinglist
(see section~\ref{sec:mailinglist}). If you have developed your own

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:imple}
\subsection{General construction}
This section explains the general idea of the class, how paper
dimensions are chosen and how slides are created. We start with the
paper.

This class uses the same idea as \pf{prosper} and \pf{HA-prosper},
namely that we create a background with \pf{pstricks} and position
text on it using |\rput| and some |minipage| environments. This is
easier than writing a dedicated output routine that can handle all
the material, but doesn't break pages when we don't want that. So,
when starting to write the class, we first investigated how to deal
with landscape slides and paper dimensions.

The job of making landscape slides can be done using \pf{geometry}.
The paper dimension was more of a problem. As \LaTeX\ doesn't have
the huge fonts that we need for presentations, we need to scale the
usual fonts somehow. This could be done by using unusual paper
dimensions (as \pf{beamer} does) and hence relying on ps2pdf to cut
off all the redundant material. But this doesn't produce a usable
DVI or PS file. Instead, it was chosen to use DVI magnification. The
entire slide is magnified by a factor of 2 and only the top left
quarter of the paper is used (but you will never notice that due to
the magnification). As we already decided to place all material in
|minipage|s using |\rput|, we didn't need the page anymore and it
was easiest to use \pf{geometry} to just remove the page margins
altogether so that the bottom left corner would be |(0,0)| and the
top right corner |(\slidewidth,\slideheight)|.

One extra remark on the paper type is necessary. We found that most
common configurations of dvips use the |A4size| code when A4
dimensions are found. This code doesn't write an explicit PostScript
paper command in the PS document and hence programs using this PS
(like ps2pdf) don't know what paper to use and revert to the
default, which is letter paper in most cases. This, of course, is
something that we don't want and hence, \pf{powerdot} will write
these commands to the PS itself as to guarantee proper post
processing of the PS.

Now that we made the decisions on how to create proper DVI, PS and
PDF output, the next task was to create an easy interface to
overlays. To avoid counting the overlays as is necessary with
\pf{prosper}, we implemented a system that first collects the entire
body of an environment in a macro which can be reused multiple
times. During execution of the body, the overlay commands like
|\onslide| will keep a record of the biggest number that they find
and that is the number of overlays to produce. Getting the body of
the environment is done by collecting all material up to the next
|\end| occurrence. If that control sequence has the proper argument
(namely the slide that we started with), then we stop scanning and
start processing the slide. With normal use, you will not notice
this, but when doing special tricks like hiding |\end{slide}| in a
macro, the process will fail as it relies on finding |\end{slide}|
in the input stream without doing expansions. Often a work around
can be found though. Have a look for instance at how |\section|
creates a slide.

The next task was to provide a simple way to create templates. As
the class is based on the idea of having a background with some
material spread out over it, the template system follows this idea.
One argument can be used to create the background, the other
argument controls, via keys and options, several properties of the
material that should be placed. By adding an |ifsetup| key, full
control could be gained over the design of the template in every
possible setup chosen by the user.

The final task for the class was to fill in all the `details'. All
the mechanisms were present, but sometimes they should not be
active. For instance, overlays should not be created in handout
mode. Other things to add to the class were counter protection on
overlays, handles to the layout of the slide number, footnotes, a
bibliography environment, empty slides, etcetera.

We hope that this section has made clear a little bit what you will
be seeing when reading the next section with coding and why we chose
to do it this way.
