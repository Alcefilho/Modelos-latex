  Abstract                 = {This paper presents our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): &#034;Tangible Bits. &#034; Tangible Bits allows users to &#034;grasp &amp; manipulate &#034; bits in the center of users’ attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces. Tangible Bits also enables users to be aware of background bits at the periphery of human perception using ambient display media such as light, sound, airflow, and water movement in an augmented space. The goal of Tangible Bits is to bridge the gaps between both cyberspace and the physical environment, as well as the foreground and background of human activities. This paper describes three key concepts of Tangible Bits: interactive surfaces; the coupling of bits with graspable physical objects; and ambient media for background awareness. We illustrate these concepts with three prototype systems – the metaDESK, transBOARD and ambientROOM – to identify underlying research issues. Keywords tangible user interface, ambient media, graspable user interface, augmented reality, ubiquitous computing, center and periphery, foreground and background},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical algorithm integrating the 3N Cartesian equations of motion of a system of N points subject to holonomic constraints is formulated. The relations of constraint remain perfectly fulfilled at each step of the trajectory despite the approximate character of numerical integration. The method is applied to a molecular dynamics simulation of a liquid of 64 n-butane molecules and compared to a simulation using generalized coordinates. The method should be useful for molecular dynamics calculations on large molecules with internal degrees of freedom. 1. INTR~D~JCTI~N The method of molecular dynamics (MD), which has been widely used in the past for studying simple liquids and solids, has more recently been applied to molecular systems with internal degrees of freedom such as N, [l], H,O [2] and even C,H,, [3]. In applying the MD method three problems arise: (a) the choice of a suitable mechanical model, (b) the derivation of the equations of motion of the system and (c) the choice of an efficient algorithm for the numerical integration of these equations. In polyatomic molecules, the fast internal vibrations are usually decoupled from},

Next, it sketches a couple of hypothetical pervasive computing scenarios, and uses them to identify key capabilities missing from today&#039;s systems.
